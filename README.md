# Hello-World
This is me using the same tutorial as everyone else brand new to this place to create the same repository.
How do you do those square shape things right here?

I am new to this. I hope I can figure it out pretty quickly so I can start getting some basic web development going. Why didn't I major in computer programming or something. Eughh. I guess business and accting are good too. I guess.
